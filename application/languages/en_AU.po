"Architect lets you set some arbitrary breakpoints for responsive design. "
"Responsive design, however, is a lot more complicated than a handful of "
"breakpoints! It is affected by devices, content, containers and so on. To "
"provide support for all of that would severely overwhelm Architect's "
"settings. For example, for every font styling, it would need to be set for "
"every scenario. The breakpoints are therefore used on a limited range of "
"options. If you want to get serious with responsive design, you will have to "
"write a lot of custom css"
