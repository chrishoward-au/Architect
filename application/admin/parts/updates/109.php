        <p>This release has some substantial changes.</p>
        <p>First off, I have changed the version numbering. The previous version was 1.17.0 this one is 10.9. This takes pressure off to build a "v2.0!!" and instead allows me to just keep improving Architect without feeling like I have to build a next-gen version. This new numbering system is based on the release number. That is, 10.9 means this is the 109th update of Architect - which deserves it\'s own exclamation marks!!</p>
<ul>
<li>UPDATED: Changed version numbering to match releases. This is the 109th update so v10.9</li>
<li>ADDED: Showcase link a link option for images (of course only relevant if Showcase is source!)</li> 
<li>ADDED: Option in Blueprints settings to include/exclude hidden custom fields in dropdowns.</li> 
<li>ADDED: New custom field type: Email</li> 
<li>ADDED: New custom field type: Link</li> 
<li>ADDED: New custom field type: File</li> 
<li>ADDED: New custom field type: Image</li> 
<li>ADDED: New custom field type: Map</li> 
<li>ADDED: Option to select custom filed source type. Currently support standard WP and Advanced Custom Fields</li> 
<li>CHANGED: Architect Maps Extend module for Beaver Builder now requires your own Google API key.</li> 
<li>FIXED: Showcases and Testimonials not displaying extra fields metabox</li> 
<li>ADDED: Override for Skip N Posts value in the Beaver module</li> 
<li>UPDATED: Freemius SDK to 2.2.4 - Security update</li> 
</ul>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Development of the Architect Gutenberg block has been delayed as it is causing more problems than anticipated.</p>
        <p>You can, however, use the Gutenberg Shortcode block to display Architect Blueprints using Gutenberg.</p>
