        <h3><b>This release has some MAJOR changes.</b></h3>
        <h4 style="color:#069;font-size:15px;">New version numbering</h4>
        <p><b>First off, version numbering has been changed.</b> The previous version was 1.17.0 this one is 10.9. This takes pressure off to build a "v2.0!!" and instead allows me to just keep improving Architect without feeling like I have to build a next-gen version. This new numbering system is based on the release number. That is, 10.9 means this is the 109th update of Architect - which deserves it\'s own exclamation marks!!</p>
<h4 style="color:#069;font-size:15px;">Improved custom field support</h4>
<p><b>Secondly, custom field support has been greatly improved</b>, and especially Advanced Custom Fields.</p>
<p><b>New custom field types: Email, Link, File, Image, Map, ACF Repeater, ACF Group, Multivalue (e.g taxonomies, checkboxes), ACF Gallery</b></p>
<p>Click here for a demo of the <a href="https://demos.architect4wp.com/acf-fields/" target="_blank">custom fields</a>.</p>
<p>Other changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>ADDED: Option to choose from which tables to list other table fields</li>
<li>ADDED: Option to select custom field source type. Currently support standard WP and Advanced Custom Fields</li>
<li>ADDED: Custom CSS field to custom fields styling</li>
<li>CHANGED: Architect Maps Extend module for Beaver Builder now requires your own Google API key because of Google&#8217;s changes.</li>
</ul>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Development of the Architect Gutenberg block has been delayed as it is causing more problems than anticipated.</p>
