        <p>This update covers  v1.13.0 and v1.12.0. It contains a few important bug fixes, some library updates and other small changes, and more features for the Architect <a href="https://bloxtheme.com/" target="_blank">Blox</a> block.</p> 
        <p>Note: Development of the Architect Gutenberg block has been delayed as the beta status of Gutenberg is causing more problems than anticipated. There is a separate Architect Gutenberg plugin in the meantime, which anyone is welcome to test.</p>
        <p>You can, however, use the Gutenberg Shortcode block to display Architect Blueprints using Gutenberg.</p>
        <p>Checkout the full list of changes in the Changelog tab above.</p>
