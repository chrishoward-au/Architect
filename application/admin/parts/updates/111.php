        <p><b>Gutenberg block</b></p>
        <p>For those who build pages with the WordPress Gutenberg block-based page editor, Architect now has its own Gutenberg block.</p>
        <p> Special thanks to <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank">Advanced Custom Fields</a> (ACF) that made this possible. If you have a need for custom fields, I highly recommend ACF and <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank">ACF PRO</a>. Of course, Architect has extensive support for display of ACF fields in its custom fields section of Blueprints.</p>
        <p><b>Padma block</b></p>
        <p>Padma is a fork of the excellent but defunct Headway theme</p>
