      <h3><b>Architect now has Gutenberg and Padma blocks!</b></h3>
      <p><b>Gutenberg block</b></p>
      <p>For those who build pages with the WordPress Gutenberg block-based page editor, Architect now has its own Gutenberg block.</p>
      <p> Special thanks to <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank">Advanced Custom Fields</a> (ACF) that made this possible. If you have a need for custom fields, I highly recommend ACF and <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank">ACF PRO</a>. Of course, Architect has extensive support for display of ACF fields in its custom fields section of Blueprints.</p>
      <p><b>Padma block</b></p>
      <p>Padma is a fork of the excellent but defunct Headway theme</p>
      <p>Other changes of note:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ADDED: new setting to vertically centre panel when feature outside the components and either left or right of the components. This makes 2019 style layouts easier.</li>
        <li>ADDED: Settings for maximum and minimum number of paragraphs when using Dummy as the the source</li>
        <li>ADDED: Two new modern grid Blueprint Presets: <em>2019 style alternating</em> and <em>Alternating Glossy magazine excerpts</em> </li>
        <li>CHANGED: Presets selector to vertical scroll.</li>
        <li>FIXED: Using Filler Image and Dummy content now returns a different image for each post</li>
      </ul>
