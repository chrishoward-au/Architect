        <p>This release contains updates for caching of images when content source is RSS. 
        <p>Note: Development of the Architect Gutenberg block has been delayed as the beta status of Gutenberg is causing more problems than anticipated. There is a separate Architect Gutenberg plugin in the meantime, which anyone is welcome to test.</p>
        <p>You can, however, use the Gutenberg Shortcode block to display Architect Blueprints using Gutenberg.</p>
        <p>Checkout the full list of changes in the Changelog tab above.</p>
