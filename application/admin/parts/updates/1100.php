        <p>This is a big update that has been a long time coming. Thank you for your patience - various upheavals threw things out of whack.</p> 
        <p>In this version, besides many, many tweaks, fixes and changes, the focus has been on improving the Beaver Builder friendliness. </p>
        <p>The <strong style="color:tomato;">Architect Beaver module</strong> now features more filters - allowing re-use of the same Architect Blueprint to display different content - and custom styling.</p>
        <p>The other key addition is <strong style="color:tomato;">RSS feeds</strong> have been added as a <strong style="color:tomato;">content source</strong>, allowing you to display content from other sites.</p>
        <p>The latter is a precursor to supporting the WP REST API. This will require a bit of rebuilding of the backend, so won\'t be seen until version 2.0.</p>
        <p>Checkout the full lists of changes in the Changelog tab above.</p>
