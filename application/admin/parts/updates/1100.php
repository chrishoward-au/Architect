        <p>This is a big update that has been a long time coming. Thank you for your patience - various upheavals threw things out of whack.</p> 
        <p style="font-weight:bold;">The biggest change is a switch to using <a href="http://freemius.com/wordpress/features-comparison/" target=_blank><strong>Freemius</strong></a> for managing purchasing. All your licences should transfer relatively smoothly. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@pizazzwp.com" target="_blank">support@pizazzwp.com</a> if you have any difficulties.</p>
        <p>With the change to Freemius, the price of the unlimited version has been bumped up a little to reflect it\'s value. It is now $119, which also means a small increase in the renewal price of $10/year.</p>
        <p style="font-weight:bold;">In this version, besides many, many tweaks, fixes, changes and much polishing, the focus has been on improving the Beaver Builder friendliness. </p>
        <p>The <strong style="color:tomato;">Architect Beaver module</strong> now features more filters - allowing re-use of the same Architect Blueprint to display different content - and custom styling.</p>
        <p>The other main addition is <strong style="color:tomato;">RSS feeds</strong> have been added as a <strong style="color:tomato;">content source</strong>, allowing you to display content from other sites.</p>
        <p>The latter is a precursor to supporting the WP REST API. This will require a bit of rebuilding of the backend, so won\'t be seen until version 2.0.</p>
        <p>Checkout the full list of changes in the Changelog tab above.</p>
        <p style="font-weight:bold"><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you need to transfer a licence from Headway Extend store, please email me at <a href="mailto:support@pizazzwp.com">support@pizazzwp.com</a>.</p>
