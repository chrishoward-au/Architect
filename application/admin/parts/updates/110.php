        <h3><b>This release has just one but very important change.</b></h3>
        <p>The Freemius eCommerce SDK has been upgraded with an important fix to a bug caused by changes to WP that on some sites might cause an error. You may not see the error, but WP might send you a notification of it.</p>
        <p>This bug did not affect the general operation of Architect.</p>
<p><strong>View full Architect history in the Changelog tab above.</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">If your site doesn\'t look right, clear the <a href="../wp-admin/admin.php?page=pzarc_tools">Architect cache</a> and your WordPress cache if you are using one.</p>
