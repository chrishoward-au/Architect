<p>There are seven methods to displaying a Blueprint. In order of required technical know-how (easiest first), these are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Headway Block</strong> : If you are using Headway, simply place the Architect block, and then select the Blueprint to display.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Widget</strong> : Select Architect widget on WP Admin widgets screen</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shortcode</strong> : Place your cursor in the body content where you want the Blueprint to appear, and select it from the dropdown at the top of the editor. Alternatively, add <em>[architect blueprint=“blueprint” ids=“overrides”]</em> in your content at the point you want the Blueprint to appear.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Architect Builder</strong>: The Architect Builder appears on the WP Page Editor screen. It provides a simple drag and drop interface for arrange Blueprints. You do have to change the page <em>Template</em> in <em>Page Attributes</em> box to <em>Architect Builder</em> </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Actions editor</strong> : Enter the action name, Blueprint and pages to appear on</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action call</strong> : Add <em>new showBlueprint(’action’, ’blueprint’, ’pageids’);</em> to your functions.php. It should be in a function added to init action, and should be conditional on class_exists showBlueprint</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Template tag</strong> : Add <em>pzarchitect(’blueprint’);</em> to your template at the point you want the Blueprint to appear</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>blueprint</em> = the shortname of the Blueprint to display.</p>

<p><em>overrides</em> = a comma separated list of the media ids to display instead. Very useful for easily converting a WordPress gallery shortcode. eg [gallery ids=“1,2,3,5”] change to [architect blueprint=“mygallery” ids=“1,2,3,4,5”]</p>

<p><em>action</em> = the name of the action hook where you want the Blueprint to appear</p>

<p><em>pageids</em> = a comma separated list of names or numeric ids of the pages to display the Blueprint.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: In Architect Options, you can also select any Blueprint with Galleries as the content source to override the WordPress Gallery shortcode layout.</p>
